### Google Calender Authentication
`keys.json` file can be achieved from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com). After completing primary OAuth, `token.json` file will be created with a refresh token which will be stored separately in `refresh_token.json` file. No need to create this two files manually.
