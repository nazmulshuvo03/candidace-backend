  <p>Hi <%= name %>,</p>

  <p>
    Welcome to <a href="https://candidace.fyi/" target="_blank">Candidace.fyi</a>! I am thrilled to have you on board as
    you embark on your journey to land your dream job. As someone who has been through the rigours of the interview
    process, I can relate to the challenges you may face.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let me share a personal experience with you. Last year, I thought I was the perfect fit for a Product Manager role
    at a FAANG company. I made notes and prepared as hard as I could, trying to craft my stories and preempt interview
    questions. However, despite my fit and confidence, I performed poorly in the interview and faced rejection. It was a
    humbling experience that taught me the importance of proper interview practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reality is that Product Management interviews have become increasingly competitive. According to a study by
    Randstad, 50% of people feel completely unprepared for job interviews, and 57% have had a poor interview experience.
    To stand out, adequate preparation is crucial.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's where <a href="https://candidace.fyi/" target="_blank">Candidace.fyi</a> comes in. Our platform connects you
    with like-minded professionals, allowing you to practise mock interviews and receive valuable & actionable feedback.
    Studies suggest that practising 8-10 mock interviews can significantly reduce interview anxiety and improve your
    chances of acing the real interview.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, to make the most of our platform, it's essential to complete your profile. A well-crafted profile will help
    us recommend relevant peers, ensuring you get the best possible practice sessions.

    interviewing is a skill, and practice makes perfect.
